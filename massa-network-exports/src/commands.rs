//! Declaration of the public and internal Events and Commands used by
//! `massa-network` that allow external communication with other nodes.
//!
//! # Operations work flow
//! An operation batch can be send or received by the massa node. Which
//! operation is asked is managed by the `NetworkWorker`.
//!
//! Other modules has the access to all commands but the usage if they want to
//! send operation that they just noticed, they should use the command
//! `[NetworkCommand::SendOperationAnnouncements]`.

//! ```
//!
//! When receiving an operation batch from the network, the `NodeWorker` will
//! inform the `ProtocolWorker` that some potentials new operations are in
//! transit and can be requested.
//!
//! The network will inform the node that new operations can transit with
//! the propagation method `SendOperationAnnouncements` that we defined just before.
//! Then, the node will manage if he ask or not the operations inside the
//! `ProtocolWorker` on node-worker event `ReceivedOperationAnnouncements`
